# Overlay Webmap Template
![desktop screenshot](./desktop.png)
Copy this template to bootstrap a webmap with an overlay containing a form and legend area. Useful for projects with togglable and/or clickable layers that don't need space for text or data content (with the exception of project info, which can go in the about modal).
<br /> 
This template is new so no samples are deployed yet, but you can view [a working demo here](https://dvrpc.github.io/map-templates/).

## Demo
- spin up or browse through the `/demo/` folder to get a sense of how everything hooks up to make a working map.
